# Installation Guide

Next CMS features a **Universal Adaptive Installer** that simplifies setup across different environments.

## 1. Local Development (Recommended for Customization)

### Step 1: Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/crediblemark-official/Next_CMS.git
cd Next_CMS
bun install
```

### Step 2: Database Setup
Ensure you have a PostgreSQL database running. You can use Docker or a local installation.
```bash
npx prisma db push
```

### Step 3: Run Installer
Start the development server:
```bash
bun dev
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/installer`. The UI will guide you through:
1.  **Infrastructure Config**: Automatically detects your `.env` capabilities.
2.  **Site Identity**: Set your site name and description.
3.  **Admin Account**: Create the root administrator.

## 2. Cloud Installation (Vercel / Railway)

On cloud platforms, the file system is usually **read-only**. Next CMS handles this by detecting system environment variables.

### Step 1: Environment Variables
Before running the installer, set these keys in your provider's dashboard:
- `DATABASE_URL` (Required)
- `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET_NAME`, `R2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` (Highly recommended for media)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` & `NEXTAUTH_URL` (Set to your domain)

### Step 2: Push & Deploy
Push the code to your repository. Once deployed, navigate to `https://your-domain.com/installer`.

### Step 3: Adaptive Detection
The installer will show a badge **"System Env Detected"**. You can skip the configuration form and proceed directly to creating your Admin account.

## 3. Storage Configuration (Cloudflare R2)

Next CMS uses Cloudflare R2 for reliable media storage.
1.  Create an R2 bucket in Cloudflare.
2.  Assign a "Public Domain" or "R2.dev Subdomain" to the bucket.
3.  Generate an API Token (Edit permissions) and note the Access Key and Secret Key.
4.  Input these into the installer.
